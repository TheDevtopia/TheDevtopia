Followed this youtube video
How To Make A Hugo Blowfish Website: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-05mOdHmQVc by Ken Harris
but there was no description about the Hosting this website.


Got a problem of permission denied problem as my github was linked to other account.
Followed this youtube video:
[RESOLVED] Github permission denied. The requested URL returned error 403:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RQLoZUW9qwM by CodeEasy.
Problem solved. 

The project I developed with glowfish didnot connect with github. 
But what else to do. I have to try again tomorrow.
